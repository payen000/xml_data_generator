                        This tool will show this record's non-computed fields as if it were a record defined by
                        XML. This is a harmless procedure with no consequence to the records themselves. Depending
                        on the 'Records to Export' field, the field values of related records will also be shown.

                        after filling the wizard record with data (this is a bad hack but this way we avoid having
                        to patch JS further, which would make this harder to migrate and is not worth it IMHO).
                        Another workaround would be to convert the boolean fields to selection fields, which work
                        fine with current autofocus-related JS, but I believe that having to select 'Yes' or 'No'
                        instead of clicking for 'True' and 'False' feels kinda goofy. -->
